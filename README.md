Remora
======

Remora is a Ruby implementation of the Grooveshark client protocol. The
most notable reason that it doesn't use the API is so that it can access
streams. Remora runs purely in a console and uses mplayer to play the
Grooveshark streams.

Because Remora pipes the stream directly into Mplayer via a stdin, it
has a chance of working under Windows, provided that you have installed
Ruby and MPlayer. This is also better than using a temporary file on the
hard disk because Remora will never store any song to disk.

Installation / Usage
--------------------

1. Clone the git repository

    $ git clone http://github.com/danopia/remora.git

    $ cd remora/

2. Install bundler

    $ sudo gem install bundler

3. Install bundled gem dependencies

    $ bundle install

4. Start remora

    $ ./remora


Legal
-----
Unfortunately, the public API no longer provides stream access. Remora
reimplements the stream-capable API that the official Flash client uses.
The intended targets are users who can't run Flash for any reason. Since
Remora is designed to never store a byte of media to disk, streaming
with it is about equal to streaming with the official Flash client.

Either way, users of Remora should follow the official ToS (found
[here](http://www.grooveshark.com/terms)) to the letter. I am not yet
sure to what degree of legality Remora is at, though it is not in
blatant violation of anything that I can find in the ToS. If there is
anything that I missed, be welcome to contact me. Please E-mail me at
remora@danopia.net or send me a message on GitHub if you have an
account already.

Finally, here is the uppercased paragraph that everyone was expecting.
